# onstar2mqtt
A service that utilizes the [OnStarJS](https://github.com/samrum/OnStarJS) library to expose OnStar data to MQTT topics. Mostly focused around EVs, however happy to accept PRs for other vehicle types.

There is no official relationship with GM, Chevrolet nor OnStar. In fact, it would be nice if they'd even respond to development requests, so we wouldn't have to reverse engineer their API.
### Home Assistant configuration templates
Auto discovery is enabled, for further integrations see [HA-MQTT.md](HA-MQTT.md).

### TODO
1. Logging library
